hi, I'm @fizzlebritches
I'm interested in building the ideas I have into products on my own
I'm currently learning all of this from the start and I don't really know where to begin
I'm looking to collaborate on ...I guess I don't even know how to describe the things I want to do in technical terms yet. 
How to reach me...@fizzlebritches on discord. If you message me there, tell me you came from Github because I don't normally accept non-solicited invites
